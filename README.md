# React Beach resort
**Complete beach resort website project.**
The project uses React router for routing and React context API for state management.

It is hosted online at https://kougianos.github.io/react-resort/
The URL leads to a 404 page but you can then navigate to home page or rooms from there and the app will work as expected.

$ npm install
$ npm start
```
